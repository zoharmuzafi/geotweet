# Geotweet

Full stack app. The app constently collects tweets from the twitter streaming api. The app allows the user to search for tweets by location using lat (-90 - 90) and lon(-180 - 180) and distance from the location (min value of 1km). The user has an option to filter the results by key word. The app displays the top scored 250 tweets in the searched location.

The app was built as part of a backend task and it has a very basic Frontend to allow the user to interact with the server.

The app uses the twitter streaming api.
